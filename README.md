# Recap Springboot
i've learned about spring in Mision Tic 2022 but i need a good reminder and also
go further in some topics deeper in the fundamentals to really understand how it works
an then create something cool with all that knowledge

## how it works?
the idea is basically, practice every concept recreating the class and at the end make a little project
